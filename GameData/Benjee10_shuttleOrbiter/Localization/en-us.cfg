		#LOC_benjee10_shuttle_deltaWing_title = OV-100 Delta Wing
		#LOC_benjee10_shuttle_deltaWing_description = These large wing elements help to provide lift to the Shuttle Orbiter as it performs an atmospheric landing.

		#LOC_benjee10_shuttle_elevon1_title = OV-100 Outer Elevon
		#LOC_benjee10_shuttle_elevon1_description = These elevons provide pitch and roll control during re-entry and landing.

		#LOC_benjee10_shuttle_elevon2_title = OV-100 Inner Elevon
		#LOC_benjee10_shuttle_elevon2_description = The elevons provide pitch control during re-entry and landing.

		#LOC_benjee10_shuttle_forwardFuselage_title = OV-100 Forward Fuselage Module
		#LOC_benjee10_shuttle_forwardFuselage_description = The forward fuselage module contains the pressurised crew cabin of the Shuttle Orbiter. It also features four groups of integrated RCS thrusters, reaction wheels and fuel reserves. There are two primary hatches, one on the side (for entry/egress on the ground) and one aft, facing into the payload bay for EVA activity. Additionally, one of the top observation windows provides an overhead escape route in an emergency. All of the hatches can be locked or unlocked as necessary. Due to the complexity of operating the spacecraft, the OV-100 requires a minimum of two pilots to control.

		#LOC_benjee10_shuttle_kuBand_title = OV-100 Ku Band Antenna
		#LOC_benjee10_shuttle_kuBand_description = This short-range antenna allows the Orbiter to communicate with & track rendezvous targets and payloads.
