SHUTTLE ORBITER CONSTRUCTION KIT
VERSION 1.1.4
for KERBAL SPACE PROGRAM 1.8.1+

Thanks you for downloading the Shuttle Orbiter Construction Kit, a mod for KSP version 1.8.1+ by Benjee10.
This mod provides a set of parts designed to emulate the NASA Space Shuttle Orbiter. It works best paired with reDIRECT launch vehicle parts in a 2.5X scale solar system, but can be used however you please! Please consult the user manual for a brief guide on how to build and fly the Space Shuttle. 

This mod has several dependencies, namely B9PartSwitch and PlumeParty, which are bundled under their existing licenses.
