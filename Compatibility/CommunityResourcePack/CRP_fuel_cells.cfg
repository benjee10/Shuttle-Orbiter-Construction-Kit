//----------- CRP fuel cell ------------------------------------------------
//Electric power for the orbiter's subsystems was provided by a set of three hydrogen-oxygen fuel cells
//which  provided power to the entire Shuttle stack (including the SRBs and ET) from T-minus 3m30s up
//through the end of the mission. The hydrogen and oxygen for the fuel cells was kept in pairs of cryogenic
//storage tanks in the mid-fuselage underneath the payload bay liner, and a variable number of such tanks
//could be installed (up to five) depending on the requirements of the mission.
